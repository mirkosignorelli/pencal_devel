# Introduction

The aim of this document is to keep track of the changes made to the
different versions of the `R` package `pencal`.

The numbering of package versions follows the convention a.b.c, where a
and b are non-negative integers, and c is a positive integer. When minor
changes are made to the package, a and b are kept fixed and only c is
increased. Major changes to the package, instead, are made apparent by
changing a or b.

Each section of this document corresponds to a major change in the
package - in other words, within a section you will find all those
package versions a.b.x where a and b are fixed whereas x = 1, 2, 3, …
Each subsection corresponds to a specific package version.

# 2.3.x

## pencal 2.3.0

-   Released: June 2025
-   The vignette of the package is now [published in *The R
    Journal*](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2024-014/)
-   Updated DESCRIPTION and CITATION files
-   Updated documentation

# 2.2.x

## pencal 2.2.4

-   Released: March 2025
-   Added warning if input of `prepare_longdata` is not a dataframe
-   Removed patch introduced in version 2.2.3 because the problems in
    `lcmm` that broke the examples have been fixed

## pencal 2.2.3

-   Released: February 2025
-   Fixed CRAN notes on package anchors in documentation links
-   Added patch (`run = FALSE`) to examples in `?fit_mlpmms`,
    `?summarize_mlpmms` and `?fit_prcmlpmm`: some changes have been
    introduced in `lcmm` version 2.2.0 which make the example with
    `fit_mlpmms` break. It’s unclear why this is happening, and it may
    take some time until the problem is solved. Until the source of the
    problem is found, the examples for the PRC MLPMM approach may fail
    to work. The PRC LMM approach is still completely functional.

# 1.3.x

## pencal 1.3.2

-   Released: December 2022
-   Updated vignettes, including mention of new functionalities
    introduced in version 1.3.1
-   Parallelized an extra computation in `summarize_lmms` and
    `summarize_mlpmms` (this should yield computing time gains with
    thousands of longitudinal predictors)

## pencal 1.3.1

-   Released: December 2022
-   Added classes (`prclmm` and `prcmlpmm`) and corresponding methods
    (`print` and `summary`) to the package
-   Added the functions `getlmm` and `getmlpmm`
-   Added `control` argument to `fit_lmms`. This argument is used to
    pass control parameters to `nlme::lme` (see `?nlme::lmeControl`).
    See `?fit_lmms` for the defaults
-   `simulate_prclmm_data` now outputs an extra element (`theta.true`)
    containing the true parameters used to generate the data
-   Added `eval( )` when creating `baseline.covs` within
    `survpred_prclmm` and `survpred_prcmlpmm`

# 1.2.x

## pencal 1.2.2

-   Released: July 2022
-   Added `seed` argument to `fit_lmms` and `fit_mlpmms`
-   Added a fix within `summarize_lmms` in case estimation of a LMM
    fails for a bootstrap replicate
-   Fixed condition that triggers error message associated with length
    of `pfac.base.covs` in `fit_prclmm`
-   Minor updates in the vignette

## pencal 1.2.1

-   Released: June 2022
-   Improved behaviour of `survpred_prclmm` when `new.longdata` is
    provided. From this version, when all observations of a longitudinal
    predictor for a given subject are missing, a warning is produced and
    the corresponding random effects are set equal to 0 (population
    average). Previously, the function returned an error due to the
    `NA`s
-   Fixed description of `standardize` argument in documentation of
    `pencox_baseline`
-   Parallelization within `performance_prc` and
    `performance_pencox_baseline` extended to computations of naive
    tdAUC performance
-   Streamlined information messages and warnings about parallelization
    and number of cores used

## pencal 1.2.0

-   Released: May 2022
-   Added `max.ymissing` argument to `fit_lmms`: with this change, it is
    now possible to estimate the LMMs within the PRC-LMM model even if
    there are subjects with missing measurements for some (but not all)
    of the longitudinal outcomes. Within `summarize_lmms`, the predicted
    random effects when a longitudinal outcome is missing for a given
    subject are set = 0 (marginal / population average). Setting
    `max.ymissing = 0` disables such additional feature
-   Added extra check to `summarize_lmms` on subjects without any
    longitudinal information available (i.e., 100% missing on all
    longitudinal variables used in step 1)
-   Introduced dependency on `purrr` (now required by `summarize_lmms`)
-   Fixed `CRAN` dependency issue with examples in
    `simulate_prclmm_data` and `simulate_prcmlpmm_data`

# 1.1.x

## pencal 1.1.1

-   Released: May 2022
-   Added `tau.age` argument to `simulate_prclmm_data` and
    `simulate_prclmm_data`
-   Minor fix of an error message inside `fit_lmms` (row 181)

## pencal 1.1.0

-   Released: March 2022
-   Fixed subject ids displayed in the output of `survpred_prclmm`
-   Fixed bug that made `survpred_prclmm` fail when new data for just 1
    subject were supplied (added missing `drop = FALSE`)
-   Added function call to the output of `survpred_prcmlpmm`

# 1.0.x

## pencal 1.0.2

-   Released: February 2022
-   Added volume, issue and page number to CITATION file, vignette and
    help pages
-   Updated vignette with more detailed installation instructions

## pencal 1.0.1

-   Released: December 2021
-   Minor correction to package description (it was still mentioning
    arXiv instead of the *Statistics in Medicine* publication)

## pencal 1.0.0

-   Released: September 2021
-   The article describing Penalized Regression Calibration is now
    published in *Statistics in Medicine*! The article is published with
    Open Access, so anybody can freely download it [from the website of
    Statistics in Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9178)
-   Updated package description and citation info
-   Updated vignette and help pages

# 0.4.x

## pencal 0.4.2

-   Released: May 2021
-   Function `survpred_prc` replaced by two distinct functions:
    `survpred_prclmm` for the PRC-LMM model, and `survpred_prcmlpmm` for
    the PRC-MLPMM model
-   Documentation and vignette updated accordingly

## pencal 0.4.1

-   Released: April 2021
-   `fit_lmms` is now more memory efficient (`keep.data = F` when
    calling lme)
-   `fit_mlpmms` is now faster (parallelization implemented also before
    the CBOCP is started)
-   Added functions `pencox_baseline` and `performance_pencox_baseline`
-   Minor updates to the vignette

# 0.3.x

## pencal 0.3.2

-   Released: March 2021
-   Fixed CRAN error in PRC MLPMM examples (replaced `T` with `TRUE`)
-   Corrected typos in vignette

## pencal 0.3.1

-   Released: March 2021
-   Added a set of functions that can be used to fit the PRC-MLPMM
    model(s): `simulate_prcmlpmm_data`, `fit_mlpmms`, `summarize_mlpmms`
    and `fit_prcmlpmm`
-   Renamed `performance_prclmm` to `performance_prc`, and
    `survpred_prclmm` to `survpred_prc` (the functions work both for the
    PRC-LMM, and the PRC-MLPMM)
-   Vignettes and documentation updated to reflect the changes

# 0.2.x

## pencal 0.2.2

-   Released: January 2021
-   Fixed CRAN error caused by parallel::detectCores()
-   Added link to arXiv preprint in package description and vignette
-   Added CITATION file
-   Vignettes updated and revised
-   Updated references in help pages

## pencal 0.2.1

-   Added vignette: “An introduction to the R package pencal”

# 0.1.x

## pencal 0.1.2

-   Released: December 2020
-   Added the function `survpred_prclmm`, which computes predicted
    survival probabilities from the fitted PRC-LMM model
-   Added `fitted_prclmm` data object and related documentation (it is
    used in the examples of `performance_prclmm`)
-   Several corrections and clarifications added to the documentation
-   Changed displaying style for function arguments in the documentation

## pencal 0.1.1

-   Released: November 2020
-   This is the first public release of the `pencal` package. It
    comprises the skeleton around which the rest of the R package will
    be built
-   This version comprises functions to perform the following tasks:
    1.  simulate data corresponding to the PRC-LMM model (functions
        `simulate_t_weibull` and `simulate_prclmm_data`);
    2.  estimate the PRC-LMM model and its associated cluster bootstrap
        optimism correction procedure (functions `fit_lmms`,
        `summarize_lmms` and `fit_prclmm`);
    3.  compute the optimism-corrected estimates of the C index and
        time-dependent AUC (function `performance_prclmm`)
-   Note: developing an `R` package that is user-friendly, comprehensive
    and well-documented is an effort that takes months, sometimes even
    years. This package is *currently under active development*, and
    many additional features and functionalities (including vignettes!)
    will be added incrementally with the next releases. If you notice a
    bug or something unclear in the documentation, feel free to get in
    touch with the maintainer of the package!
