\title{A fitted PRC MLPMM}
\format{
A list comprising step 2 and step 3 as obtained
during the estimation of a PRC MLPMM
}
\usage{
data(fitted_prclmm)
}
\description{
This list contains a fitted PRC MLPMM. It is
used to reduce the computing time in the example of
the function \code{survpred_prcmlpmm}. The simulated dataset 
on which the model was fitted was landmarked at t = 2.
